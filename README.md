TITLE:A CHUCK NORRIS JOKE COUNTER

AUTHOR: SAM MAINA

The code you provided is a Chuck Norris Joke Generator web page with a heart button to like the joke.

The HTML file contains the basic structure of the webpage with the title, header, joke text, and a generate button. It also includes a heart button with a counter and styling for the page using CSS.

The JavaScript file fetches a random Chuck Norris joke from the API and displays it on the page when the Generate Joke button is clicked. It also resets the like counter to zero and updates the number of likes when the heart button is clicked.

The jQuery script toggles the heart button's active state and updates the number of likes accordingly.
